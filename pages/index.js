        <p>Hello! My name is Moses Uriarte and I am a software engineer in the making. I currently attend Lehman College and I am in my senior year. I aspire to one day
        have the chance to teach others what I have learned in my time at Lehman College and in my own personal time. I have had the chance to complete a Java intensive
        bootcamp with ApprenticeNow/Woz-U, but due to CO-VID I was not given the chance to work for them... it was heartbreaking, but we must PREVAIL and I will oneday become
        that software engineer!
        </p>
